// SCHEDULER
//
// This scheduler implements a *cooperative*, *single-thread–owned* coroutine
// execution loop for the Jule runtime. It is designed as a low-level runtime
// component, not a user-facing abstraction.
//
// The scheduler operates similarly to an event loop: it repeatedly polls a
// runnable coroutine, resumes it, and re-integrates it into the system based on
// its post-resume state.
//
// The scheduler does NOT implement coroutines itself. Instead, it operates on
// opaque coroutine handles provided by the runtime ABI.
//
// The scheduler is designed according to the C:M:P model:
//
//	C (Coroutine)
//		A suspendable state machine generated by the compiler.
//		Conceptually, it is an async function, but it is not part of the user's
//		ordinary control flow. It is detached and it may execute concurrently at
//		any time, and its scheduling is fully managed by the scheduler.
//		It behaves similarly to a typical thread.
//
//	M (Machine)
//		A real operating system thread.
//		It is responsible for executing a coroutine.
//		Only as many M instances may be created as permitted by COMAXPROCS.
//
//	P (Processor)
//		A scheduler processor. It owns its own local state.
//		An M must be paired with a P in order to execute a coroutine and perform
//		scheduling. An M can be paired with only one P at a time, and a P can be
//		paired with only one M at a time.
//
// Async functions may call other async functions and, through an await chain,
// form a chain of state machines. The scheduler does not take responsibility
// for lifetime management of each individual state machine. It is only
// responsible for managing the lifetime of coroutines (detached state machines).
//
// A coroutine may only be resumed by the scheduler.
// When a parked coroutine is woken up, it must be enqueued into the runnable
// coroutine queue. The scheduler decides when it will actually execute.
//
// STACK-ORIENTED COROUTINE HANDLING
//
// Jule runtime prioritizes avoiding heap allocations for coroutines.
// Each coroutine instance is used from the stack. When necessary,
// it can be copied or passed around via references/pointers.
// Since it is stack-oriented, it must be handled carefully.
// Otherwise, a stale coroutine copy may be used and cause critical issues.

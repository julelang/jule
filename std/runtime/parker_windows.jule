// Thread parking for Windows-based systems.
//
// Following information and implementation is adopted from Rust:
// https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/350d0ef0ec0493e6d21cfb265cb8211a0e74d766/library/std/src/sys/sync/thread_parking/windows7.rs
//
// This uses WaitOnAddress and WakeByAddressSingle (supported on Windows 8+).
// This modern API is exactly the same as the futex syscalls the Linux thread
// parker uses. The implementation of this thread parker matches the Linux
// thread parker exactly.
//
// WaitOnAddress first checks the state of the thread parker to make sure it no
// WakeByAddressSingle calls can be missed between updating the parker state
// and calling the function.
//
// Notes about memory ordering:
//
// Memory ordering is only relevant for the relative ordering of operations
// between different variables. Even atomic::Relaxed guarantees a
// monotonic/consistent order when looking at just a single atomic variable.
//
// So, since this parker is just a single atomic variable, we only need to look
// at the ordering guarantees we need to provide to the 'outside world'.
//
// The only memory ordering guarantee that parking and unparking provide, is
// that things which happened before unpark() are visible on the thread
// returning from park() afterwards. Otherwise, it was effectively unparked
// before unpark() was called while still consuming the 'token'.
//
// In other words, unpark() needs to synchronize with the part of park() that
// consumes the token and returns.
//
// This is done with a release-acquire synchronization, by using
// atomic::Release when writing NOTIFIED (the 'token') in unpark(), and using
// atomic::Acquire when reading this state in park() after waking up.

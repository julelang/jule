// Implements custom encoder method for text encoding.
// For types with this method, this method is called instead of the default

// Successful encoding should not throw any exceptions.
// It should return UTF-8 encoded text in bytes.

// Implements custom decoder method for text decoding.
// For types with this method, this method is called instead of the default
// decoding strategy and custom decoding is performed. The data parameter is the
// corresponding data equivalent and is always UTF-8 encoded text in bytes.
// It may be a mutable copy taken from the data used for decoding, so any change may
// cause mutation in the main data. According to the defined behavior,
// decoder methods should not mutate the content of the data.
// Throwing any exception is considered valid. The thrown exception will be
// forwarded by the decoder. Successful decoding should not throw any exceptions
// and self should be changed as required.

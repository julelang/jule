use "std/runtime"

// Returns an integer comparing two strings lexicographically.
// The result will be 0 if a == b, -1 if a < b, and +1 if a > b.
//
// Use compare when you need to perform a three-way comparison (with
// [slices::SortFunc], for example). It is usually clearer and always faster
// to use the built-in string comparison operators ==, <, >, and so on.
fn Compare(a: str, b: str): int {
	ret runtime::compareStr(&a, &b)
